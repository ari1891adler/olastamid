olastamid is a siddur written in XeLaTeX markup language. The siddur is in accordance with Western Ashkenazi custom as outlined by Machon Moreshes Ashkenaz (http://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/)

One must be running XeLaTeX (not just LaTeX) in order to build the code.

The Bidi package is necessary in order for Hebrew text to be properly displayed in XeLaTeX. 

Bidi and Hebrew have sometimes caused unexpected results in the page layout, so creative workarounds were necessary.
